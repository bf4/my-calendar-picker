Progress:
Proof of concept, parsing my calendars into the embed url format

Todo:
# put default cal in iframe with list of other available calendars for mixing in, up to 10 max, I think
# better config, and oauth. omniauth?
# allow editing of calendars, or creating a new calendar
# allow sharing
# allow inviting
# make it look good
# use any icalendar
# import from csv or ics
